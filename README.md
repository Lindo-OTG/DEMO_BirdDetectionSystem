# Project Startup
Build C# code, navigate to the bin folder and run the .exe file.

If you cannot run the program, you can open the solution to view the source code and forms.
even if you do manage to run the project i still suggest you open the source code to get a grasp of my coding and logic.

# Regards
This is a rough concept, with a lot of room for improvement, project is not in progress or in use, but the concepts and ideas are still valid, so any suggestions would be appreciated.
